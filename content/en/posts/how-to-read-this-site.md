This site is an _open project notebook_. It consists of two distinct parts; a traditional blog (the part you are currently reading), and a separate site resembling a documentation knowledge base, kb.parrhall.com. 

The goal of this site is to act as the place where I document and dicuss the various projects I am working on. These projects are primarily focused on:

**Linux systems programming**: Developing against the Linux API using C, Rust and Go.  

**Embedded Linux (eLinux)**: Using Buildroot and Yocto to create eLinux images; developing for the Raspberry Pi OS; pushing eLinux/Linux boundaries eg desktop environment limitations in Raspberry Pi OS.  

**GUI development for Linux/eLinux**: How does the window/display manager or compositor work, how to define new GUI components and widgets, and the current state of Wayland-generation GUI tools.  

**Linux device drivers**: Writing device drivers for Linux/eLinux, types of drivers, device busses, the hell of USB drivers, typically using one of the three systems languages.  

**Firmware development**: Writing device firmware in C, Rust and Micropython, exploring various hardware types and their specific code requirements and SDKs, and controlling sensors and other physical components.  

**Thin clients**: Various permutations of Linux and eLinux thin clients.  
     
What all of this means in real terms is that this is a semi-private place where I show my work publicly, most often so I can share with colleagues and other buds who might be interested in some of my projects. Quite a lot of this site is devoted to simply me figuring stuff out, and some of that stuff is wildly out of range of my normal work. That means some areas go into what may seem like excessive detail, and others gloss over big topics with opinionated summaries. I also spend quite a bit of time documenting the problems I encounter and their ultimate resolutions, which means some pages in the kb are flagged as blockers. This is a part of the work; I don't hide when I am still figuring something out. 

If you're reading this site, you likely have some interest in the project topics themselves. This site can be approached either from the 'opinionated summary' angle - the blog is dedicated to these summarized writeups - or the 'excessive detail' angle - by going directly to the kb and looking through the detailed sections. The kb is grouped roughly by topic, but quite a lot of the topics have overlapping edges. The blog is sorted by categories, if you want to zoom in on a specific area of interest. 

A comment on the translations: the site is first written in English, translations are generated, and then I go back and manually improve the translations over time. The improvements are constrained by my own language learning skills and that the translations are usually something I come back to when I am frustrated on the project work. I am happy to accept translation PRs if something reads poorly!

All the topics written about on this site are open source. This site itself and the kb are also open source, under a Creative Commons license; please do not be a jerk and attribute accordingly. If you care enough about an error you see on this site, please open a PR with a correction in the respective repository.
